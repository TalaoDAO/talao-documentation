# TEZOS4EUDIW

Updated the 13th of February 2026.

TEZOS4EUDIW is a web application that allows users to prove ownership
of a crypto wallet and receive a verifiable attestation (EAA) representing that
ownership in their EUDI wallet.

The application enables the issuance of a Proof of Crypto Ownership
credential bound to a Tezos wallet address, using the OpenID for
Verifiable Credential Issuance (OIDC4VCI) standard.

## What it does

TEZOS4EUDIW provides the following functionality:

- Connects to a user's Tezos crypto wallet using Beacon
- Requests the user to sign a message to prove control of their wallet
  address
- Verifies the signature server-side
- Issues a verifiable credential attesting wallet ownership
- Delivers the credential to the user's EUDI wallet via QR code
- Notifies the web application when credential issuance is complete

The issued attestation can then be used as a trusted proof that the user
controls a specific Tezos crypto address.
