# Talao FAQ

### What can I do with Talao?
Talao gives users the ability to take back control of their personal information and share it with Web 3 applications when required. For example, with Talao, users can present digital credentials (Over 18 proof, KYC, etc.) to access services or take advantage of offers (membership card, loyalty card, exclusive pass, etc.).

### Why is Talao called a Universal wallet and how is it different from other digital wallets?
Talao is called a 'Universal wallet' because, like a physical wallet that holds ID cards and funds, the Talao wallet gathers digital credentials (ID card, age proof, diploma, etc.) and digital assets (cryptos, NFTs, tokens). The wallet is built on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), which allows users to manage digital credentials in a decentralized and privacy-preserving way.

### What is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)?
Self-Sovereign Identity, or SSI, is a blockchain-compatible technology that gives users and organizations control over their digital credentials and identity data, without relying on a central authority. SSI allows users to manage and share their data privately and securely, using technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proof and Selective Disclosure to protect privacy.

### How can I use my Talao SSI wallet to manage and share my verifiable credentials?
When you receive a verifiable credential in Talao, it is added to your digital identity. You can use it to prove your identity or access services, like using a membership credential for members-only areas or an 'Over 18' proof for DeFi apps. Use the "scan" button to share credentials via QR code, then accept the request to share.

Talao wallet is self-custodial and secured with military-grade encryption and biometric authentication. Your data is encrypted and stored on your device, providing enhanced privacy and security.

### What does it mean that Talao is "self-custodial"?

### Are there any risks related to verifying my address to get a 'proof of ownership' in Talao?
No, there is zero risk. You don’t need to share or disclose any passphrase or private keys to get a proof of ownership. Simply scan a QR code with your crypto wallet to receive a credential that proves you hold the private key of the address. Talao wallet is never connected to your crypto wallet.

### How does Talao wallet protect my personal information?
Talao uses SSI technology to store and manage personal information in a decentralized, secure, and private way. All personal information is encrypted and stored on your device. Only you control when and what data to share.

### Where are my digital credentials stored in Talao?
Your digital credentials are encrypted and stored on your phone. There is no central database or cloud storage. This decentralized model is why it’s called "Self-Sovereign Identity" (SSI)—you alone control your data.

### What are Verifiable Credentials and why are they useful?
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital claims, representing information like ID cards, proof of age, or crypto address ownership. They are tamper-proof, digitally signed, and instantly verifiable by a third party, making them secure and reliable.

### What is 'Selective Disclosure'?
Selective Disclosure allows SSI users to reveal specific pieces of information about their identity without disclosing sensitive data. For example, you can prove you're 'Over 18' without revealing your name or address, enhancing security in online interactions.

### What is Talao and what makes it unique?
Talao is a "Universal wallet" that manages both digital credentials (e.g., identity proofs, diplomas) and digital assets (cryptos, NFTs). It is based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), allowing users to control their digital identity in a decentralized and privacy-focused manner.

### What is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)?
SSI allows users to manage their own digital credentials without relying on a central authority. It provides decentralized identity management, enhanced privacy, and security through technologies like Zero-Knowledge Proof and Selective Disclosure.

Users can then conveniently share their verified data off-chain via a QR code or link whenever needed. 

### How does On-Chain verification work ?
After verification, users can create non-transferable NFTs (or SBTs) as binary proofs to confirm aspects about themselves on-chain. These proofs do not reveal any specific user data. 
Decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts can then monitor users' verification status by checking for compliance SBTs in their wallets.
