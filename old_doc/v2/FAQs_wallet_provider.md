    <summary>How does Off-Chain verification work?</summary>
    
    Once a user's identity is verified, the Wallet Provider issues cryptographically signed proofs (verifiable credentials) that are re-usable and instantly verifiable. Users can then conveniently share their verified data off-chain via a QR code or link whenever needed.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How does On-Chain verification work?</summary>
    
    After verification, users can create non-transferable NFTs (or SBTs) as binary proofs to confirm aspects about themselves on-chain. These proofs do not reveal any specific user data. Decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts can then monitor users' verification status by checking for compliance SBTs in their wallets.
